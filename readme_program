You will find here an R package I authored (autoRegLGM2), and a simulation folder. You will need to install the package before running the simulation. To install the package, use the "install" function in the devtools package. 

To run the simulation, edit master_file.R in the simulation folder for your environment. Edit the parameters to your heart's content, and run everything. Before doing so, please ensure that the packages in functions.R are installed. 

The main way the code is limited right now is that only four time points are supported. That's something I'm getting around to fixing up. Additionally, for now only non-informative priors for item parameters are used. Finally, I will say that my dissertation has been going on for many years. I have done my best to eliminate all of the swearing in the source code, but I'm not sure I got it all.
