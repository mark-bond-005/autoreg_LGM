You will find here an R package I authored (autoRegLGM2), and a simulation folder. You will need to install the package before running the simulation. To install the package, use the "install" function in the devtools package. 

To run the simulation, edit master_file.R in the simulation folder to your environment, edit the parameters to your heart's content, and run everything. Before doing so, please ensure that the packages in functions.R are installed. 

Finally, I will say that my dissertation has been going on for many years. I have done my best to eliminate all of my swearing in the source code, but I'm not sure I got it all.
