# autoreg_LGM
R and C++ code useful for time series analysis on dichotomous data

This project shares some of the code used for my dissertation (Bond, 2018), so that anybody who wants to replicate or improve upon my work may do so. The project involved writing a Gibbs sampler for a second-order latent growth model, using the Kalman filter; informative priors may be incorporated for item parameters.

Please check readme_statistics for a basic overview of the statistics behind what I am doing. If, instead, you are already familiar with the statistics, please check readme_program for instructions on how to correctly run this code.
